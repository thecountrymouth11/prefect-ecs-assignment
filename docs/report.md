# DevOps Internship Report

## Why Terraform
I picked Terraform because it’s simple and works with AWS and other clouds. It’s popular in DevOps jobs.

## What I Learned
- **Terraform**: It’s like a blueprint to build things automatically.
- **AWS ECS**: Runs the chef (worker) without managing servers.
- **Prefect**: Sends tasks to the worker, like a recipe app.
- **Networking**: Sets up rooms (subnets) for safety and internet access.
- **IAM**: Gives permissions, like a manager’s badge.

## Challenges
- **Problem**: Hard to understand ECS at first.
  - **Fix**: Watched YouTube videos on ECS Fargate.
- **Problem**: Worker didn’t connect.
  - **Fix**: Checked logs in AWS and fixed API key.
